# BSTChain Hash Table

Welcome to the BSTChain Hash Table, a program that demonstrates a chained hash table using a binary search tree (BST) for collision resolution. Users can perform operations like inserting, deleting, finding, and displaying items in the hash table.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: Enter the size of the hash table and the initial number of items.

2. **Operations**:
    - `show`: Display the current state of the hash table.
    - `insert`: Insert a new item with a specified key value.
    - `delete`: Delete an item with a specified key value.
    - `find`: Find an item with a specified key value.

3. **Example**:
    - To display the hash table: Enter `s`.
    - To insert a new item: Enter `i` and provide the key value.
    - To delete an item: Enter `d` and provide the key value.
    - To find an item: Enter `f` and provide the key value.

4. **Exit**: The program runs indefinitely, and you can exit manually.

## Getting Started

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the hash table.
